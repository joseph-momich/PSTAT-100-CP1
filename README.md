### Attempted to clean the data. 
'Tidy-Data' is the file where raw data is imported and cleaned. The data was imported as a .csv file, not an Excel one. I just downloaded the original Excel file as a .csv, since it was easier to work with. The final data set was then exported as a '.csv' file and used in the project-plan-report.pynb
# V3: Please edit this one (Mar 6)
Added Background Information describing source/data collection/etc. on Part 1 of the project.
