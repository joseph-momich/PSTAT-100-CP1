### Attempted to clean the data. 
'Tidy-Data' is the file where raw data is imported and cleaned. The data was imported as a .csv file, not an Excel one. I just downloaded the Excel file as a .csv, since it was easier to work with. The final data set was then exported as a '.csv' file and used in the project-plan-report.pynb
