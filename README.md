# PSTAT-100-CP1

## V1: Version 1 
## V2: Version 2 
### Attempted to clean the data. 
'Tidy-Data' is the file where raw data is imported and cleaned. The data was imported as a .csv file, not an Excel one. I just downloaded the original Excel file as a .csv, since it was easier to work with. The final data set was then exported as a '.csv' file and used in the project-plan-report.pynb
## V3: Version 3
Added Background Information describing source/data collection/etc. on Part 1 of the project.
## V4:
Deleted a few more columns from the original data set that were missing most of the time and were just comparison statistics.
Added variable descriptions to Part 1 and organized the description into paragraph format.
