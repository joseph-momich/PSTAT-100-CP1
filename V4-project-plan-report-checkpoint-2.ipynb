    "California has a well-developed public transportation system that includes buses, trains, light rail, and subways. The state's largest public transportation agency is the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), which serves the Los Angeles metropolitan area with an extensive network of bus and rail lines. Other major public transportation agencies in California include the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS). In addition to these larger agencies, many smaller cities and towns throughout California have their own public transportation systems, which may include buses, shuttles, or other types of services. These systems often provide connections to regional or statewide transportation networks, making it possible for people to travel throughout the state using public transportation. While many areas have well-established public transportation systems, there may be gaps or limitations in service in some parts of the state, particularly in more rural or remote areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Walkable Distance to Public Transit dataset, available on data.ca.gov, provides information on the number of households in California that are within a certain distance of public transit stops. The data is based on estimates of walking distance from households to the nearest transit stop, as well as information on the types of transit services available at each stop. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is organized by county, and includes information on the number and percentage of households within various walking distance ranges of transit stops. For example, the data might indicate how many households are within a 5-minute walk of a transit stop, as well as how many households are within a 10-minute or 15-minute walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also provides information on the types of transit services available at each stop, including whether the stop serves buses, trains, or other modes of transportation. This information can be useful for understanding the accessibility of public transportation in different areas of the state, and for identifying opportunities to improve transit service or expand transit infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Walkable Distance to Public Transit dataset is a valuable resource for policymakers, transportation planners, and researchers who are interested in understanding the availability and accessibility of public transportation in California."

    "The data is the percent of the population that resides within 1/2 mile of a major transit location (bus/rail/ferry stop) in four California regions, and whose waiting time is less than 15 minutes during peak commute hours. The data is stratified by 8 race/ethnicity groups and includes both geographic information and statistical reliability measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected by the California Department of Public Health, as part of the \"Health Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI). The goal of the project was to evaluate how city plans and policies affect community health. The data includes 2012 Transit Stops from the San Diego and Southern California Association of Governments, as well as the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. It also includes 2008 Transit Stops from the Sacramento Council of Government and 2010 block-level population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The data is updated decennially. The four California regions are defined as the following:\n",
    "* Southern California (SCAG): Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura \n",
    "* Sacramento (SACOG): Placer, Sacramento, and Yolo \n",
    "* Bay Area (MTC): Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma \n",
    "* San Diego County\n",
    "\n",
    "Data values were obtained using automated methods to download information from various public websites. One important data set was from the 2010-2012 California Household Travel Survey. Multiple data collection methods were used in this survey, including computer-assisted telephone interviews and online/mail surveys. To identify census blocks inside 1/2 mile of the transit stops, geospatial software was used. In order to compile the data into one data set, the census blocks from the 2010 U.S. Census were merged with the blocks from the transit data, and population counts were aggregated by census tract, cities/towns, county, and region. The data was processed into Excel files with standard formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "The population is adults aged 18 years and over, who reside in the four California regions. The sampling frame includes adults in these four regions, with access to telephone or mail services. The sampling mechanism for the respective year (2008 or 2012) is a probability sample because the surveys downloaded by the HCI project were sent to randomly selected adults However, the scope of inference has limitations. The data is from the year 2012 for the SCAG, MTC, and San Diego regions; while, 2008 for the SACOG region. Some transit stops and services may have changed during that time period. As well, the population data was collected from the 2010 U.S. Census, which is a different time period than the transit data (2008, 2012). Therefore, some variation may exist if demographics changed."
